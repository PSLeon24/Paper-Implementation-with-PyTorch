### 1. SRCNN
- Paper title: Image Super-Resolution Using Deep Convolutional Networks
- Category: Image Super-Resolution
- Paper URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00092
- Abstract
  - This paper presents a method for single-image super-resolution (SR) using deep learning, specifically through Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to enhance the resolution of a low-resolution (LR) image to a high-resolution (HR) image, preserving the image's quality and details.

- Abstract
  - This paper introduces AlexNet, a deep convolutional neural network that achieved breakthrough results in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) 2012. The model significantly improved the accuracy of image classification tasks by employing a deeper and wider architecture compared to previous methods. Key innovations include the use of Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) for nonlinearity, dropout for regularization, and data augmentation techniques. AlexNet's success demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning in large-scale image recognition tasks, paving the way for further advancements in the field.
