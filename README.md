### 1. SRCNN
- Paper title: Image Super-Resolution Using Deep Convolutional Networks
- Category: Image Super-Resolution
- Paper URL: https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00092
- Abstract
  - This paper presents a method for single-image super-resolution (SR) using deep learning, specifically through Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to enhance the resolution of a low-resolution (LR) image to a high-resolution (HR) image, preserving the image's quality and details.

### 2. AlexNet
- Paper title: ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
- Category: Image Classification
- Paper URL: https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf
- Abstract
  - This paper introduces AlexNet, a deep convolutional neural network that achieved breakthrough results in the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) 2012. The model significantly improved the accuracy of image classification tasks by employing a deeper and wider architecture compared to previous methods. Key innovations include the use of Rectified Linear Units (ReLU) for nonlinearity, dropout for regularization, and data augmentation techniques. AlexNet's success demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning in large-scale image recognition tasks, paving the way for further advancements in the field.

### 3. ResNet
- Paper title: Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition
- Category: Image Classification
- Paper URL: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385
- Abstract
  - This paper introduces ResNet (Residual Networks), a deep convolutional neural network that addresses the problem of training very deep networks by using a novel architecture called "residual learning." The key idea is to add shortcut connections (or skip connections) that bypass one or more layers, allowing the network to learn residual functions with reference to the layer inputs. This significantly eases the training of deep networks and allows the construction of networks with hundreds or even thousands of layers, achieving state-of-the-art performance on image classification tasks. ResNet won the 1st place in several tracks of the ILSVRC 2015 competition and has become a foundational model in the field of deep learning.
