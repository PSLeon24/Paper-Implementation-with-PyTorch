- Abstract
  - This paper presents a method for single-image super-resolution (SR) using deep learning, specifically through Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal is to enhance the resolution of a low-resolution (LR) image to a high-resolution (HR) image, preserving the image's quality and details.
